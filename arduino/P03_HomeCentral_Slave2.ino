 *  Last Modified on: 06-Apr-2019
 *  
 *  This is the complete sketch required for the HomeCentral_Slave2 circuit and is assembled in the following steps:
 *  - First assemble the Nano and an NRF24L01 radio module exactly as in P02_001 and P02_002. Then:
 *  - P03_001_HomeCentral_Slave2_Relay.fzz: Adding a 4-channel relay with connected devices to be turned on and off.
 *  - P03_002_HomeCentral_Slave2_MotionSensor.fzz: Adding a motion sensor to turn on a light when motion is detected and send data to the master.
 *  - P03_003_HomeCentral_Slave2_SoundSensor.fzz: Adding a sound sensor to turn on a light when sound is detected and send data to the master.
 *  
 *  Refer to the comments to see which sections of code are required at each step.
 *
