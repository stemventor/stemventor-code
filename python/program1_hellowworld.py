# This is a very simple program that does nothing but print
# Hello World to the console. It has been a traditional approach
# for many years to start learning a new language with a 
# Hello World program.

# START PROGRAM

hello_world = "Hello World!"
print(hello_world)

# You can also make this an interactive greeting by taking the user name as input
greeting = "Hello "

person_name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello " + person_name)

# END PROGRAM
