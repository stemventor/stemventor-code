/* 
 This is a very simple program that does nothing but print
 Hello World to the console. It has been a traditional approach for
 many years to start learning a new language with a Hello World program.
 
 This will get you started on understanding and using the IDE
 and making sure your development environment is working fine.
  
 First thing to learn, these lines of text starting with 
 a forward slash (/) and an asterisk (*) 
 and ending with an asterisk (*) and a forward slash (/)
 are comments. These are used to explain the lines of code and
 are ignored by the compiler and computer when executing the code.
 You can type anything in comments, except the comment start 
 and end markers.
*/

// Starting a line with two forward slashes is another way to write a comment
// This is better for single line comments, while the previous approach 
// is better for multi-line comments.

// The actual program starts now:
// START PROGRAM

let text_to_print = "Hello World" // Define a variable and assign it a text value

console.log(text_to_print); // Print the text to the console

// END PROGRAM
// To open the console type ctrl+` and go to the DEBUG CONSOLE tab

// Run the program by pressing the F5 key (could be Fn+F5 or just F5 depending on your keyboard configuration)
// Select the Node.js compiler if asked and see the display in the console.
