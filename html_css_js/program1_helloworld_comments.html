<!-- 
  This is a simple HTML page that displays the text "Hello World". 
  It has been a traditional approach for many years to start 
  learning a new language with a Hello World program.
  
  This will get you started on understanding and using the IDE
  and making sure your development environment is working fine.
  
  It will also introduce you to the concepts of writing a web page using
  HTML.
  
  First thing to learn, these lines of text are comments.
  Note the start and end marker, they are a bit long. 
  These are used to explain the lines of code and
  are ignored by the compiler and computer when executing the code.
  You can type anything in comments, except the comment start 
  and end markers.
