	Using HTML and CSS you can present very well designed pages hyperlinked to each other 
	However, they do not provide any processing capability and that is where JavaScript comes in.
	In this program we will also introduce forms, which are a way to get input from a user.
	Using a combination of HTML, HTML forms, CSS, and JavaScript we will build a simple version 
	of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game, where a user can play against the computer.
