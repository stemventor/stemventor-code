<!-- 
  While HTML gives you some basic tags for headings, bold and italics, users today expect applications
	to look a lot better and have a clean and attractive user interface.
	A language known as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to achieve this styling.
	Each part of an HTML document is referred to as a an element.
	Depending on the element, various styles are possible.
	Styles are defined in a .css file in the form of "classes". 
	These "classes" are then applied to elements where the styling is required.

<html>
<!-- Inside the head tag you include some information about the page. -->
<head>
  <!-- The title is what shows on your browser tab. -->
  <title>Hello World</title>
	<!-- Add a link to the CSS file that has the required styling. -->
	<link href="program3_styling.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
</head>
<!-- Inside the body tags you include the actual page content to be displayed. -->
<body>
  <!-- Let's add some styling to the text -->
	<!-- Instead of a simple h1 tag let's create a title in a box with a border and a background color and center it -->
	<!-- Look for the box-title class in the .css file -->
